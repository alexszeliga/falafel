# Falafel Menu Controller CRUD App

This is a full stack web app that utilizes an MVC architecture 

# A Bespoke ORM

It includes a hand-coded object relational mapper that allows the one model, the falafel model, to execute basic CRUD commands:

* Create a new record
* Read existing records
* Update status of records
* Destroy records

# How to Use it:

Upon opening the app, deployed on Heroku (here)[https://boiling-ridge-62389.herokuapp.com/], the menu is populated from a MySQL database table.

Active menu items populate on the left, inactive on the right. Active menu items can be deactivated. Deactivated menu items can be reactivated or deleted.

The user can add a new menu item using the form at the bottom.
